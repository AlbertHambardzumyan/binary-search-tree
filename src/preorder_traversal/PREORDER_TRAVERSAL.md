# Preorder Traversal

Write recursive method *`preorderTraversal`* to traverse the tree and print the node values.

The preorder traversal processes the value in each node as the node is visited. After processing the value in a 
 particular node, it processes the values in the left subtree, then processes the values in the right subtree.
